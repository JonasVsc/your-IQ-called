## Divide and Conquer

A divide-and-conquer algorithm breaks down a large problem into smaller subproblems, which themselves may be broken down into even smaller subproblems,
and so forth. The recursion bottoms out when it reaches a base case and the subproblem is small enough to solve directly without further recursing.
