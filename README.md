## Introduction

The objective of this repository is to provide a centralized resource for learning and practicing data structures, algorithms, and common coding interview questions. Each topic is well-documented and accompanied by examples and practice problems to help you solidify your understanding.

## Data Structures

Here you'll find implementations and explanations for a variety of data structures, including:

- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Tree
- Graph
- Hash Table
- Heap
- And more...

## Algorithms

This section covers fundamental algorithms, including:

- Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort)
- Searching algorithms (e.g., Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search)
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking
- And more...

## No Link Problems
These are custom problems without direct links. Solutions and tests for these problems will be provided, although it may take some time. Stay tuned for updates and new problems. Happy coding!

### Arrays
1. Finding a single missing element in an array
2. Finding multiple missing elements in an array
3. Finding duplicates in a sorted array
4. Finding duplicates in an unsorted array
5. Finding a pair of elements with sum K
6. Finding a pair of elements with sum K in a sorted array
7. Finding the maximum and minimum in a single scan
